👋 Hi, I’m @KelvCodes
👀By day, i'm a frontend engineer, a web developer and an AI Researcher 🤖 
🚀 By night 🌙, I dream of becoming a full stack developer 
🌱 I’m currently learning the intricacies of **React** and **Node.js** to expand my skillset and build dynamic, user-centric applications.
💞️ I’m looking always to collaborate on open-source projects that push the boundaries of web development and foster a collaborative community.
