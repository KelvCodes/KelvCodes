👋 Hi, I’m @KelvCodes
👀 I’m interested in full-stack development, crafting elegant and efficient solutions that bridge the gap between the front-end and back-end.
🌱 I’m currently learning the intricacies of **React** and **Node.js** to expand my skillset and build dynamic, user-centric applications.
💞️ I’m looking always to collaborate on open-source projects that push the boundaries of web development and foster a collaborative community.
📫 Reach me on email at onlykelvin06@gmail.com and +233 24447 2771 on WhatsApp!
😄 Pronouns: he/him 
⚡ Fun fact: I once built a fully functional website in a single weekend, just for fun!😂
