👋 Hey there! I’m @KelvCodes(Kelvin)
👀By day, i'm a frontend engineer, a web developer and an AI Researcher 🤖conversant with MEAN Stack. 
🚀 By night 🌙, I dream of becoming a full stack developer who will be able to handle the entire lifecycle of web applications.
🌱 I’m currently learning the intricacies of **React** and **Node.js** to expand my skillset and build dynamic, user-centric applications.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that push the boundaries of web development and foster a collaborative community.
